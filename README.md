### Hello, I'm Huiyu! :)

![GitHub Contribution Snake](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/github-contribution-snake/output/github-contribution-grid-snake.svg)

I work on the project for Google Summer of Code ([GSoC Project](https://huiyuxie.github.io/)) and I am now in Hawaii!

Surfing, cycling, and photography are my passions!
